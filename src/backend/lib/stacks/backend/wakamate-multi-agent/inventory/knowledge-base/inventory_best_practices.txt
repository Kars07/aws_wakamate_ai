Inventory Management Best Practices

Stock Level Optimization:
- Maintain 21-30 days of inventory for fast-moving items
- Keep 60-90 days for slower items
- Reorder when stock hits 2x lead time demand

Profitability Analysis:
- Target minimum 25% gross margin
- Calculate: (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price × 100
- Focus restocking on high-margin, fast-moving products

Restocking Priorities:
1. Critical: Out of stock items with high demand
2. High: Low stock with <14 days until stockout
3. Medium: Items approaching minimum stock levels
4. Low: Slow-moving items with adequate stock

Velocity Calculations:
- Daily Velocity = Units Sold / Days
- Days Until Stockout = Current Stock / Daily Velocity
- Recommended Order = (Daily Velocity × Lead Days) + Safety Stock
